## How to set it up
* download : api.py, finalmodel.pickle, venv
* open a termimal and go to the directory 
* run the virtual env, type in the termimal : `venv\Scripts\activate`
* run the api, type in the terminal : `python api.py` , the api is now running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
* to test sample request to the api, run in another terminal :  `python request.py`
